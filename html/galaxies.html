        The Andromeda Galaxy (IPA: /ænˈdrɒmɪdə/), also known as Messier 31, M31,
        or NGC 224 and originally the Andromeda Nebula (see below), is a barred
        spiral galaxy approximately 2.5 million light-years (770 kiloparsecs)
        from Earth and the nearest major galaxy to the Milky Way. The galaxy's
        name stems from the area of Earth's sky in which it appears, the
        constellation of Andromeda, which itself is named after the Ethiopian
        (or Phoenician) princess who was the wife of Perseus in Greek mythology.
        The virial mass of the Andromeda Galaxy is of the same order of
        magnitude as that of the Milky Way, at 1 trillion solar masses (2.0×1042
        kilograms). The mass of either galaxy is difficult to estimate with any
        accuracy, but it was long thought that the Andromeda Galaxy is more
        massive than the Milky Way by a margin of some 25% to 50%. This has been
        called into question by a 2018 study that cited a lower estimate on the
        mass of the Andromeda Galaxy, combined with preliminary reports on a
        2019 study estimating a higher mass of the Milky Way.[13][14] The
        Andromeda Galaxy has a diameter of about 220,000 ly (67 kpc), making it
        the largest member of the Local Group in terms of extension, if not
        mass.[citation needed] The number of stars contained in the Andromeda
        Galaxy is estimated at one trillion (1×1012), or roughly twice the
        number estimated for the Milky Way.[needs update] The Milky Way and
        Andromeda galaxies are expected to collide in around 4.5 billion years,
        merging to form a giant elliptical galaxy or a large lenticular galaxy.
        With an apparent magnitude of 3.4, the Andromeda Galaxy is among the
        brightest of the Messier objects, making it visible to the naked eye
        from Earth on moonless nights, even when viewed from areas with moderate
        light pollution.

        also known as NGC 3034, Cigar Galaxy or M82) is a starburst galaxy
        approximately 12 million light-years away in the constellation Ursa
        Major. A member of the M81 Group, it is about five times more luminous
        than the whole Milky Way and has a center one hundred times more
        luminous than our galaxy's center.The starburst activity is thought to
        have been triggered by interaction with neighboring galaxy M81. As the
        closest starburst galaxy to Earth, M82 is the prototypical example of
        this galaxy type. SN 2014J, a type Ia supernova, was discovered in the
        galaxy on 21 January 2014.[8][9][10] In 2014, in studying M82,
        scientists discovered the brightest pulsar yet known, designated M82 X-2
        Discovery M82 was first discovered by Johann Elert Bode on 31 December
        1774 together with M81; he described it as a "nebulous patch", about
        0.75 deg away from M81, "very pale and of elongated shape". In 1779,
        Pierre Méchain independently rediscovered both galaxies and reported
        them to Charles Messier, who added them to his catalog M82 was
        previously believed to be an irregular galaxy. In 2005, however, two
        symmetric spiral arms were discovered in near-infrared (NIR) images of
        M82. The arms were detected by subtracting an axisymmetric exponential
        disk from the NIR images. Even though the arms were detected in NIR
        images, they are bluer than the disk. The arms were previously missed
        due to M82's high disk surface brightness, the nearly edge-on view of
        this galaxy (~80°),[7] and obscuration by a complex network of dusty
        filaments in its optical images. These arms emanate from the ends of the
        NIR bar and can be followed for the length of 3 disc scales. Assuming
        that the northern part of M82 is nearer to us, as most of the literature
        does, the observed sense of rotation implies trailing arms.

        The Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) is a satellite galaxy of the Milky
        Way.[5] At a distance of around 50 kiloparsecs (≈163,000
        light-years),[2][6][7][8] the LMC is the second- or third-closest galaxy
        to the Milky Way, after the Sagittarius Dwarf Spheroidal (~16 kpc) and
        the possible dwarf irregular galaxy known as the Canis Major
        Overdensity. Based on readily visible stars and a mass of approximately
        10 billion solar masses, the diameter of the LMC is about 14,000
        light-years (4.3 kpc), making it roughly one one-hundredth as massive as
        the Milky Way.[3] This makes the LMC the fourth-largest galaxy in the
        Local Group, after the Andromeda Galaxy (M31), the Milky Way, and the
        Triangulum Galaxy (M33). The LMC is classified as a Magellanic
        spiral.[9] It contains a stellar bar that is geometrically off-center,
        suggesting that it was a barred dwarf spiral galaxy before its spiral
        arms were disrupted, likely by tidal interactions from the Small
        Magellanic Cloud (SMC) and the Milky Way's gravity. With a declination
        of about −70°, the LMC is visible as a faint "cloud" from the southern
        hemisphere of the Earth and from as far north as 20° N. It straddles the
        constellations Dorado and Mensa and has an apparent length of about 10°
        to the naked eye, 20 times the Moon's diameter, from dark sites away
        from light pollution. History of observation Small part of the Large
        Magellanic Cloud Although both clouds have been easily visible for
        southern nighttime observers well back into prehistory, the first known
        written mention of the Large Magellanic Cloud was by the Persian
        astronomer 'Abd al-Rahman al-Sufi Shirazi (later known in Europe as
        "Azophi"), in his Book of Fixed Stars around 964 AD. The next recorded
        observation was in 1503–1504 by Amerigo Vespucci in a letter about his
        third voyage. In this letter he mentions "three Canopes [sic], two
        bright and one obscure"; "bright" refers to the two Magellanic Clouds,
        and "obscure" refers to the Coalsack. Ferdinand Magellan sighted the LMC
        on his voyage in 1519 and his writings brought it into common Western
        knowledge. The galaxy now bears his name. The galaxy and southern end of
        Dorado are in the current epoch at opposition on about 5 December when
        thus visible from sunset to sunrise from equatorial points such as
        Ecuador, the Congos, Uganda, Kenya and Indonesia and for part of the
        night in nearby months. Below about 28° south the galaxy is always
        sufficiently above the horizon to be considered properly circumpolar,
        thus spring and autumn also are seasons of much-of-night visibility, and
        the height of winter in June nearly coincides with closest proximity to
        the Sun's apparent position. Measurements with the Hubble Space
        Telescope, announced in 2006, suggest the Large and Small Magellanic
        Clouds may be moving too fast to be orbiting the Milky Way.

        The Pinwheel Galaxy (also known as Messier 101, M101 or NGC 5457) is a
        face-on spiral galaxy distanced 21 million light-years (6.4
        megaparsecs)[3] away from Earth in the constellation Ursa Major. It was
        discovered by Pierre Méchain on March 27, 1781 and was communicated to
        Charles Messier, who verified its position for inclusion in the Messier
        Catalogue as one of its final entries. On February 28, 2006, NASA and
        the European Space Agency released a very detailed image of the Pinwheel
        Galaxy, which was the largest and most-detailed image of a galaxy by
        Hubble Space Telescope at the time.[8] The image was composed of 51
        individual exposures, plus some extra ground-based photos. On August 24,
        2011, a Type Ia supernova, SN 2011fe, was discovered in M101. Pierre
        Méchain, the discoverer of Messier 101, described it as a "nebula
        without star, very obscure and pretty large, 6' to 7' in diameter,
        between the left hand of Bootes and the tail of the great Bear. It is
        difficult to distinguish when one lits the [grating] wires." William
        Herschel noted in 1784 that "...in my 7-, 10-, and 20-feet [focal
        length] reflectors shewed a mottled kind of nebulosity, which I shall
        call resolvable; so that I expect my present telescope will, perhaps,
        render the stars visible of which I suppose them to be composed." Lord
        Rosse observed M101 in his 72-inch-diameter Newtonian reflector during
        the second half of the 19th century. He was the first to make extensive
        note of the spiral structure and made several sketches.[9] To observe
        the spiral structure in modern instruments requires a fairly large
        instrument, very dark skies, and a low-power eyepiece.
